They are super comfortable. The material is on the thinner side and has a bit of a stretch to it. That means I won\u2019t be warm enough in the winter, but I have been comfortable wearing these when mowing or doing other yard work, I ordered a 30x32, and in my mind the waist is a little large, but the length is just right. The length is ever so slightly shorter than I would like. I am often between a 29 and 30 waist, and think that a 29 may have fit better in this cut.<br /><br />For my taste, these are quite casual and that works well for what I needed them for. I like that they have cargo pockets for when I work around the house.I ordered these for business casual work pants that I wear at the office. They are fine for that, but nothing to write home about. The material has just enough stretch to be comfortable but not look like sweatpants. I am not impressed with how easily these wrinkle.<br /><br />I had read some reviews prior to ordering and the general consensus was that this material shrinks when machine drying with heat. Based on that I chose to air-dry these rather than machine dry. Generally, I like pants that I can machine dry, since that takes out the majority of the wrinkles, and it is just easier/faster.<br /><br />The pockets are a good size, and are large enough to comfortably hold my iPhone X, yet not absurdly deep. The button rear pockets add a bit of style, and the double button fly (one hidden inside) is a nice touch to keep it flat at the waist.These are my go-to pants for business attire - especially when that involves traveling. These pants are not only very comfortable, but they also happen to be nearly wrinkle free. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can\u2019t bunch them into a ball and expect no wrinkles, however, if you do a reasonable job of folding them you won\u2019t have to iron them once you unpack them. Moreover, they don\u2019t tend to get wrinkled from wearing them for the day.<br /><br />I like that there is no button on the outside front, as it avoids the belt buckle getting hung up. Also, the front pockets are easy to access since they are vertical rather than horizontal (such as jean pockets). The fabric has a fair amount of stretch to it, which makes them very comfortable. I find the fit to be very flattering - almost an athletic fit but not excessively narrow legs.<br /><br />I will be replacing my black and grey dress pants with these...at Christmas :)I ordered these pants to replace some worn out work jeans that were long past their prime. These pants make great work pants because they are loose enough to not restrict movement. They are a little baggier than I would like, but not excessively baggy. Also, the side pockets make it easy to carry small items or tools when on the go, or on a ladder.<br /><br />The material seems less durable than denim, but time will tell. I like that it is thinner than denim, so I won't get too hot. I would recommend wearing long johns under these if you are working in cold climates.These are one of my go-to pants for business attire - especially when that involves traveling. These pants are very comfortable, and wrinkle resistant. They are not truly wrinkle free like some others, but they do fair much better than standard dress pants.<br /><br />I like that the CK logo is color-matched and nearly blends in. The waist has a bit of stretch to it, which I find makes these really comfortable for sitting for long times. Overall, these are really nice pants!!"}, "AHZGQXTGR3WB6CQR3PP2TB2YPTUA_2": {"user_profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for comfortable, high-quality clothing across various categories, particularly focusing on items that offer versatility and practicality.

It\u2019s rose gold with white dial and roman numerals and this combination goes quite well. I tried getting the picture to show but the dial is not regular white, it\u2019s pearly white which is even prettier. The bracelet is little wider at the ends where is meets the watch and then it narrows down toward the clasp. Entire watch including the bracelet is protected with the plastic foil to prevent the scratches. It comes in aluminum box with the cute design on it which is Fossil signature box but unfortunately mine came all beat up and the box was squished beyond repair. This is the 2nd box from Fossil I received like this so I am starting to think they use faulty boxes for samples maybe? I bought Fossil watches before and never received a box this beat up. Anyways, I will not deduct the stars based on the box but beware in case you are giving as a gift. I would order early just in case I need to replace. Otherwise 4 solid stars rating for this beautiful little watch.Fossil did a nice job with this watch. It\u2019s casual and pretty, it can be dressed up or down. Roman numerals are large and easy to spot, same goes for hands. There is a nice contrast between hands and face so the hands can be easily spotted. Hands and numerals are gold and the face is silver color. There are 3 more tiny dials indicating day of the week, date of the month and 24-hour time. I love the size, not tiny but not taking over my wrist. Zirconiums around the casing are subtle and not too flashy and the rim has interesting details that really make a big difference.This watch by Dona Karan is very pretty, simple yet elegant. Silver tone with no zirconium or anything too flashy makes it perfect every day watch that will match with many styles. This is great for office, work, night out or grocery shopping. You see where I am going with this, very versatile style. It\u2019s fairly small (26mm) and has little dots instead of numbers and DNKY on the face. DNKY is also engraved on the back of the watch and the clasp. I had to remove a link to fit my wrist. It\u2019s water resistant up to 160ft which is a bare minimum for me but its worth mentioning. It will withstand swimming in shallow water, showering but not diving.I like this little blue watch by Lacoste. The band is silicone but textured on both inside and outside which helps preventing the sweating and allows the skin to breathe. I have medium size hand and this watch fits nicely on my wrist. The style is casual and maybe sporty. It will go perfect with the jeans. Water resistant but not waterproof. Basically you can wash your face in the morning but cant swim. I hate having to remove the watch so this is a little bummer for me. The band, the case and the face are all blue, Lacoste \ud83d\udc0a is engraved on the bracelet, buckle and the watch face. Many small and hidden Lacoste\ud83d\udc0a logos as a reminder this is genuine brand watch. It\u2019s SUPER lightweight, I don\u2019t even feel it on my wrist.This review is for the white version of this beautiful watch by Kate Spade. Main photo here looks like the bracelet is somewhat beige but it\u2019s actually pearly white. All other pictures are accurately reflecting the color. This watch is beautiful and much prettier then in the pictures. Band is white but it looks like it\u2019s made out of marble or some sort of white stones. Really unique. I am a watch maniac and have way more than I need but this is my first band that looks like this. Face is clean, simple and elegant - all in Kate Spade style. Little spade \u2660\ufe0f sign on 12 o\u2019clock is a nice detail and easily noticeable. The style is casual but can be dressed up or down. It\u2019s water resistant and can\u2019t handle washing dishes, hands and shower but no swimming or diving. I showered with it and no issues with that."}, "AHZGQXTGR3WB6CQR3PP2TB2YPTUA_1": {"user_profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for stylish and functional clothing and accessories, particularly in the women's and children's categories.

It can pass for either a dress shirt or as casual wear. That's what Oxford shirts do. They are made with a type of weave that creates a heavy cloth (100% cotton in this case). It isn't shiny like some dress shirts, and because of its heavy fabric, it doesn't wrinkle as easily as some casual shirts. In short, this shirt passes muster in both the dress up and dress down worlds. And as an Amazon Essentials brand, it is very affordable, at $16.00. Furthermore, it appears to be well made and is likely to last a long time. This is definitely a good buy.My husband likes this shirt a lot. It was comfortable out of the package and extremely lightweight. The shirt fits him perfectly, but only because I anticipated a problem with Amazon's Goodthreads brand. A Goodthreads shirt I reviewed before fit my husband more tightly than its advertised medium size, so I experimented by getting a large this time. It was the right decision. My husband usually wears a medium with other brands, so the issue isn't with him: Goodthreads has a size issue. Bottom line: The shirt comes highly recommended, but I'm deducting a star because of the size problem.My husband reports that this shirt meets his standards for a basic shirt. It's made from a lightweight 100% cotton fabric and is comfortable for the most part, though he says the collar is a bit scratchy. I assume that a few washes will take care of that problem. As I have come to expect from Amazon's Goodthreads brand, the size of this shorts runs a bit small. The item is not yet posted on Amazon, so I don't know its price. Assuming the price is reasonable--and I expect it will be--my husband and I give this shirt a thumbs-up.My husband is a big fan of the Amazon Goodthreads brand. The shirts are invariably comfortable and made from durable material. They are also reasonably priced. This denim plaid shirt is no exception, and it gets a thumbs up from my husband. As is also typical of the brand, however, sizing runs small, so you're cautioned to order a size up.This 100% cotton shirt is light weight and very comfortable right out of the package. This separates it from most new shirts, which tend to be a bit stiff and chafing when brand new. The size label is accurate: this medium shirt fit my medium-sized husband perfectly. Wrangler's 100% satisfaction guarantee is also a nice feature. It allows customers to return the shirt within one year of purchase for any reason except abuse, accidental damage, or wear. The only caveat is that we don't know how durable the shirt will prove to be. The same feature that makes it so comfortable--its light weight--may result in faster wear than you'd get with heavier fabric.This shirt is perfect for my husband, who hates dressing up. This white linen shirt would not pass close inspection as a dress shirt, but it's close enough. And that thrills my husband, because the shirt is very soft--even around the collar--and lightweight. In short, this is a terrific buy for someone who doesn't like dressing up because it can pass as a dress shirt without imposing the discomforts of standard dress shirts.My husband looks for comfort in his clothes, not labels, and this shirt passes his test for shirts. It is a lightweight, 100% cotton shirt that is comfortable out of the package. It comes with two spare buttons (one for each of the two different sizes on the shirt). As I expect for a designer shirt, it is well constructed. There is a very small CK label at the breast. I'm not a fan of visible designer labels, but this one is unobtrusive enough for me to ignore. However, my normal complaint about the premium paid for designer labels is certainly true in this case. This large shirt lists at $57, which is crazy high, as nice as it is. I can find comparable, non-designer shirts at lower prices. There's also a weird difference in price for this shirt depending on the size you select. The price ranges from about $25 to about $60, despite that they all seem to be shipped and sold by Amazon rather than third-party sellers. Weird.

It fits well, is very comfortable, and looks good under clothes, nice and smooth.<br /><br />I haven't bought any new bras for at least a year and I just recently realized that I really need to replace all my old bras! They are mostly 34A with maybe a couple 36A. I have been an A cup my whole life (except for right after giving birth) but I'm just not fitting into them well anymore. Honestly, I'm probably more of an A-plus or B-minus than a full B cup, but since neither of those were an option I decided to give the 36B a try.<br /><br />It fits nicely, with just a touch of extra room. It feels so nice not to be crammed into the wrong size bra anymore, with nothing bulging out from the top or sides. It looks really good and smooth, and feels nice and silky on the skin. There is no pinching, itching or discomfort. I really love this bra and I want to try other Warner's styles. I highly recommend this bra, it's a great value and a good quality product.Amazon Essentials Women's Wireless Support Bra<br /><br />This bra is nicely padded and it looks smooth under a t-shirt. The support is good and it's fairly comfortable for a bra. I've noticed it feels kind of itchy and irritating for me all around the lower edge and strap, not sure why. But it's actually more comfortable than most of my bras. So, if I have to wear a bra (only when I go out in public, haha!) I've been grabbing this one first ever since I got it. I cut out the obnoxious tags, it would be really nice if they would switch to tagless. Also the strap could be a bit wider at the back. All-in-all a good bra at a good price (around $15).True & Co Women's True Body Triangle Convertible Strap Bra<br /><br />I, like probably a lot of women, have been on a lifelong search for the perfect bra. That holy grail of bras, one that has the perfect combination of support, coverage and comfort... well, I'm sad to report that this bra is not it.<br /><br />Although it's amazingly comfortable, and the coverage and padding are good (no nipples showing), it's really lacking in lift and support. I am small-chested, in between an A and B cup, and this bra just flattens me out. Worn under a t-shirt I look flat-chested and have no shape. I sincerely wish this bra was more supportive because I can wear it all day long with no discomfort whatsoever. It will work great for days that I'm lounging around at home but want to feel like I actually accomplished something and got dressed (I put on a bra, see! I'm dressed! I'm out of my pj's! LOL), but I won't feel comfortable wearing it out in public unless I have a lot of layers on.<br /><br />Sigh, the quest continues...True & Co Women's True Body Scoop Neck Bra<br /><br />This is probably the most comfortable bra I've ever worn in my life! I actually forget it's there. It's smooth and silky and soft and there is absolutely no pinching or squeezing. And the pads provide good coverage. True & Co makes amazing, great quality bras!<br /><br />Be aware that the scoop neck is higher than your average bra so you won't be able to wear it with some things because it will show.

The outsize check is definitely casual but is not at all garish.This is a very nicely made shirt, that can be dressed up or down. Even though it is long sleeved the fabric is loosely woven enough to be quite breathable. It fits well across the shoulders, tapers a bit through the body and the sleeves are long enough. The deep navy blue color would look sharp with white or light khaki trousers as well as dressed up with a blazer and tie for an evening out. The lightweight and versatility of this shirt would make this an excellent choice to take on vacation.This is a very nicely made Hawaiian shirt. The linen blend fabric is a bit heavier than these shirts often are but the linen/cotton blend is breathable and will be more comfortable in hot, muggy weather than a shirt made with a synthetic blended fabric would be. The bright blue paisley design is bright and colorful but not as bold as some of this type of shirt. The shirt sleeves and overall length are appropriately long. The buttons are sewn in well and of good quality. There is a pocket that is conveniently placed and sized to hold sunglasses.This is a great shirt for dressy casual wear. It could be paired with jeans for a relaxed look, or with dressier slacks or shorts for a more sophisticated one. The fabric is a midweight cotton, so probably not a first choice for wearing outside on extremely hot days but it is certainly a good choice to wear from warm through cool days on it own or layered with a sweater or jacket for cold ones. The styling is trim fit, with just enough 'preppy' touches, including a small logo on the pocket to make this a good casual wear choice. The workmanship is good, which is to be expected from this brand.This is a very well made shirt. The fabric is 100% cotton, and has a nice finish. The stitching is even and well done and the color is a lovely light blue. This shirt is definitely cut for a trim, if not slender figure. I ordered this for my husband, a former gymnast who is a slender build with broad shoulders and long arms. In order for a shirt to fit him perfectly it needs to be custom made. This shirt fit him quite nicely, although the sleeves could have been a bit longer they will probably be just fine for most others."}, "AHXVJEGZ4ZD6RO2ZKTYRBC2PTOAQ": {"user_profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for comfortable and practical clothing, particularly in the activewear and casual categories.

Roomy enough, stretchy enough and comfy enough for a young woman without modesty issues. For anyone else, (over 40 and/or a cup size larger than C) it's hard to get on and off and provides very little support. Frankly, if you fall in that category and plan to stay at home, save yourself the effort of wrangling the thing on and forget the bra altogether.Feels fantastic if you don't move around. Cup size and coverage very good but had there been an odd size (41, for example) would have been perfect. Wish I had ordered a bust size down. Also for me, being thick at the shoulders, straps a bit on the short size. If you not just big busted, but heavy all over, will ride up all the time.When the description read 'cotton' I expected that would be on the inside cup. It isn't, which could be an issue if your outerwear is material that might 'bunch or catch'. However, on the upside, this is definitely a comfy bra. Maybe not enough support to wear out and about but great for around home.

I've purchased so many for my husband over the years. They're so comfortable and soft but still a nice thick cotton (my husband hates thin cotton shirts \ud83d\ude02). They wash nicely and don't shrink much if at all. They're great for using on Cricut projects (ironing on patches, vinyl etc). My husband buys a size large and he is 5'8-9 and weighs roughly 175 pounds and has a longer torso so he loves that this fully cover his mid section and doesn't ride up as much as normal shirts do. Very happy with these shirts!***Update: My husband loved these shirts so much that I bought some for my Dad and he's obsessed too! for sizing reference my father is roughly 6 foot, weighs 160 pounds and has very broad shoulders so I bought him the XL and they fit great. These shirts would also be amazing for custom t-shirts, Cricut creations or other iron-on vinyl projects too! \ud83d\ude0d.<br /><br />These shirts are AMAZING!! They are made of a nice thick cotton but still very breathable. The sizing on the shirt was exactly as expected. My husband is 5'8 and weighs roughly 180 pounds. He doesn't like tight fitting shirts and he normally wears a size large. The large size in this shirt fits him perfectly and even has a little more length to it than most shirts we find which we loved because my husband has a slightly longer torso and hates when his shirts ride up when he's working on things, so having that extra inch or so in length makes all the difference!<br /><br />The shirt also offers exceptional color options. We purchased the navy blue color and black color and it is very vibrant in person. The shirt itself looks exceptionally well made and durable. Again, they are a nice thick cotton and not a thin shirt and is so insanely comfortable. We've washed it a few times now and it's held up beautifully and hardly shrank if at all! Definitely a quality shirt at an amazing price. My husband is very happy with it and we would definitely recommend it.AMAZING Carhartt quality. These t-shirts are a nice thick cotton but still very breathable. They are THE perfect all purpose work shirt but look at the sizing chart carefully as they do tend to run large!<br /><br />My husband is 5'8 and weighs roughly 180 pounds. He doesn't like tight fitting shirts and he normally wears a size large so that's what I originally purchased. Unfortunately I had forgotten that Carhartt runs larger than other brands so I had to return the large and exchange it for a medium. One thing we LOVE about Carhartt shirts is that they tend to run a little longer than other brands of t-shirts. My husband has a slightly longer torso and hates when his shirts ride up when he's working on things so having that extra inch or so in length makes all the difference!<br /><br />The color options in this t-shirt are absolutely beautiful and are identical to the photos. They are great looking t-shirts and all of the colors are very vibrant in person. The t-shirt also has the Carhartt logo printed across the chest. This shirt is truly a great, all purpose work shirt that you can wear all year round. They are so insanely comfortable. My husband LOVES it.

It gives the shirt a youthful look that makes him look a little more stylish. The shirt looks good loose or tucked in and can be worn dressed up but looks more casual.<br /><br />The fabric is a nice weight chambray that is well made and a great color. The plaid design looks good too without being overbearing. The stitching is even and the buttons fit well in the button holes.<br /><br />My husband is normally a size medium and the shirt fits him exactly how he likes it. Neither of us could find anything about this shirt we didn't like. It's a great addition to his wardrobe that was in desperate need of an update.I ordered this in a medium. My husband is on the small side of medium and this shirt fits perfectly. The sleeves are a great length as is the bottom of the shirt.<br /><br />The shirt is made with 100% cotton that feels crisp and comfortable. It also means the shirt is prone to wrinkling and we have used the steamer on it to get out the wrinkles. It's really the only thing we don't love about the shirt.<br /><br />Otherwise the shirt looks great. The button down collar is preppy looking without a tie. It can easily be tucked into pants for a more business attire look. The logo is small on the front pocket so it looks good without being to conspicuous. There really isn't anything we don't like about the look for the fit. It's an all around great shirt.My young adult son is not very broad shouldered and sometimes drown in men's shirts. I was excited to try the custom fit and found that it fits him perfect. The buttons lay flat and don't pull at all across the chest. Also, the length is perfect for wearing untucked yet can still be tucked in.<br /><br />The fabric on this shirt is good quality. The cotton is crisp and wears well. The biggest drawback with the 100% cotton is that it wrinkles and needs to be ironed. We like shirts that we can pull out of the dryer and wear. The shirt is also a bit see thru. This shirt works for both casual wear and office attire.<br /><br />Now that we have found the Hilfiger custom fit, we want to stick with this as it does fit better than a lot of other button down shirts. However, I would not recommend the custom fit for those who are broader in the shoulders but it works for us. Overall a great looking shirt that looks modern and classy.I got this shirt for my husband and I like the way it looks on him. He's not as keen on the color combination as I am but I think the red, blue, and white look good together. The material on the shirt has a good weight and I like that we can pull it right out of the dryer and it doesn't have to be ironed.<br /><br />As for the fit, my husband usually fits between a small and medium. I decided to go with the small on this one and I'm glad I did as it fits him perfectly and fits better than a medium he has of the same brand.<br /><br />Overall, there is nothing about this shirt we don't like. It's classic looking and goes with a lot of different pants."}, "AHX35E56YZ5UK76Z3MRN7TD73CNA": {"user_profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for comfortable and versatile clothing, particularly in the women's apparel category.

The shorts are so well made and have a real nice casual look. If only they fit me I would be in heaven having found my perfect summer leisure shorts. I should have upped a size which is what I recommend.These shorts are very nice and very well made. They are the perfect length, fit the body nicely and have the perfect thickness to the material. They are very soft to wear without being too thin. All is great except for they do seem to be a slim fit. I used to be a size 36 and this past summer went down to a size 34 in shorts. That is what I have here but they are a snug fit. I can still wear them but sadly not with a shirt tucked in. Excellent quality shorts with a style that just fits a little too close.I tend to wear only off white shorts during the summer. They go with everything. But I am going on many vacations this year and wanted some more variety in casual shorts that will go with tanks, tees and casual shirts. Just looking for a comfortable pair of shorts I can slip on no problem. I wear a 34/36 short and went with the 36 and the fit is perfect. Not too big while not being at all snug. The olive color is not dark as it can be but rather on the lighter side. Very attractive and these will go with everything. Also impressed with the material. There is some heft to them but they are very comfortable. These will be great for sightseeing, getting up and slipping on for some leisure time. So glad to have found a perfect addition to my summer and especially vacation wardrobe. Also want to add I was very impressed with how well they are made and I foresee them being very durable. Highly recommend.These shorts get raves all around. Fit is perfection, comfort is amazing and quality/durability is excellent. The olive color is also really nice and goes with everything. I got a 36. I wear between a 34 and 36 and these fit just the way I like for casual summer shorts. Some room without being too loose or too snug. Highly recommend these. So if this inseam is what you are looking for don't hesitate. Perfect summer leisure shorts that provide much comfort.I am loving Calvin Klein's line of shorts this summer. These follow in the great comfort of others I have gotten this summer. Really nice casual and classic fit with the Calvin Klein expected quality and durability. These have a slight stretch in the waist as well so if on vacation and you eat a little too much you are still all set. I find a pair of classic white shorts always necessary and these fit the bill for casual to dressier warm weather wear. Highly recommend.These Nautica shorts are pretty nice but interestingly being advertised as having a little stretch the material does seem to but not the waist. The waist is a little snug and I got my regular size of 36 not even needing that extra elasticity in the waist. The material is a combination of being a little heavy and soft at the same time. Certainly ideal for summer. The heaviness doesn't make them too warm. I do find them to be more formal shorts, even more dressy than Docker shorts. They sit directly at the waist (perhaps the reason for the snugness) and fall to right above the knee. I see them more as shorts for older guys or someone who likes very dressy attire. Nice with a button down shirt or polo but not casual enough to wear with a tank or t shirt. Very well made and durable with nice deep pockets. I am happy to add them to my summer collection but do prefer my shorts a little more versatile. But that is just a preference of mine.

The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit. I would recommend keeping the packaging and getting a size up as there has been a rash of too small Carharrt items lately, and with that said it is still worth the trouble to get ahold of these canvas slacks.<br />5 Stars A++ RECOMMENDED<br />VOTE thumbs UP IF YOU FOUND THIS HELPFULThese were only a disappointment for me because I could not get the size right, painless return though.

They appear to be made well, with sturdy hardware (zipper, button), which is important when you expect a pair of jeans to last for awhile. They do run a little large, especially in the waist. The waist rides a little high on me. Also, they are longer than my other jeans, which, for me, is an inconvenience. I generally just wear flat shoes with my jeans, and these are going to hit the floor (even though I am 5' 8\" tall), which will probably cause them to wear out and eventually fray at the bottom. I may end up rolling them up and cuffing them.<br /><br />Other than that, the material is very stretchy, soft, and comfortable. I did a lot of sitting, standing up, and stretching, and just movement in general and the jeans were very comfortable and fluid. I would have given them 5 stars except for the long length (these are labeled as Medium length), and, also, the fabric has that awful, strange chemical smell straight out of the package. So much so, I wore a thin pair of pants underneath these jeans in order to try them on before I wrote this review. I didn't want the chemicals next to my skin, and they are going straight into the laundry hamper before wearing.<br /><br />Would I recommend these jeans to a friend? Yes. The price is great. I would also warn them about the long length and tell them that they might want to go down a size to get the best fit. They are decent jeans and deserve 4 solid stars.I ordered these skinny jeans for my adult granddaughter. She prefers the high rise style of jeans, and these jeans are true to size and fit her like a glove. The regular length is great for her (she is 5' 4.5\"). The fabric is sturdy but soft and comfortable, with plenty of stretch, which is what you need in skinny jeans that hug that body. They are well made and the hardware is very good. These are a great pair of jeans, and Daily Ritual products are generally very reasonably priced. We are both very happy and highly recommend these jeans.I almost didn't order these jeans because my normal size for pants in other styles is a 20, and a 22 in Wrangler jeans is even just slightly on the large size. But, I figured, these are Levi's (which I have always found to fit small for the size), and, they are also skinny jeans, which means they may be even smaller than a normal size 24. Well, I am very pleased to report that the size 24 worked great for me. If you wear a 24 in other brands of jeans, I would definitely go up a size. I didn't want to dock any stars from my review for the size issue since it is so common with Levi's brand to begin with. Plus, the jeans are fantastic. They are super stretchy and really comfortable. They move when you move, and they don't bag out after wearing for awhile. The hardware and the seams are all top quality and done very well. My favorite part about them is that for a denim jean, they are lightweight. They are not your typical heavy denim, and will not weigh you down in any way. It also means they can dress up, depending on what type of shirt or sweater you wear with them. If you like heels, these look great with heels. I am 5'7\" to 5'8\" tall (not too sure these days...getting older), and the length is really nice for me. It's perfect for flats or heels. I definitely recommend these jeans for quality and comfort, just know how you personally fit into Levi's jeans and order your size accordingly. You will be pleased.These jeans feel as soft as butter. The fabric is wonderful. They have just enough spandex and combination of other fabrics to make them fit close to the body, and it also gives them great movement--they move when you do. The workmanship is perfect, and I would expect nothing less from Levis. My adult granddaughter absolutely loves them. She is probably closer to a size 28, but even though these are a size bigger, they still fit. They are slightly loose in the waist, but, that just means she won't have to unbutton them after a big meal! The looser waist also means she can tuck in tops, even those with bulkier fabrics. She is average height (about 5' 4\") and the length is perfect on her. They can easily be worn with both flats and heels. I think these jeans are pretty close to perfect, and so does she. We both highly recommend them.These jeans are absolutely amazing. The quality of the construction and the fabric is excellent. The fabric is lighter weight than your standard denim. The hardware is top notch, too. They also feel amazing. They definitely resonate with the 7 for All Mankind brand. The fit is absolutely true to size (even though the manufacturer suggests going a size down--maybe due to the stretch). If you are between sizes, then I would suggest going with the smaller of the two sizes, because otherwise you may find them too big in the waist. These jeans are designed for women with curves.<br /><br />The ankle length is really cute, and they look great with heels or a simple pair of flats (pairing them with flats gives you a great retro look). If you are not very tall, then the ankle length style may actually fit you just as a 'regular length' pair of jeans. One thing I really like is that while they may be 'skinny' jeans in style, they are not so tight (especially around the ankle bottom) that they feel constricting. They are machine washable, too. I absolutely love them.<br /><br />NOTE: If you are looking for this brand of skinny jeans in a similar (but not exactly the same), full length style, you can check out: [[ASIN:B06Y4J7BZR Jen7 Women's Skinny Jeans, Black Knit, 12]].These jeans are absolutely amazing.

They are so nice!<br />I am so glad I tried this style of underwear and I would definitely recommend that you consider trying boy briefs. They are just so comfortable!This is a comfortable bra. It has a hook and eye closure in the back. It fit as I thought it would and was mostly comfortable to wear all day long. The only problem was that the straps slid a bit. It's such a nice satiny smooth material that I think just adjusting the straps and tightening them up a bit may fix the problem. Other than that I had absolutely no issues at all. The bra was very comfortable. I am always a bit leery of underwire bras but this one wasn't even slightly noticeable. I'd but more of this style definitely.

The cups are very soft due to the lining in them, so comfy. The straps adjust from the front, which is so much better than the back, and the straps are also convertible. You can crisscross them in the back! There is no pinching or prodding of any kind. The straps stay put, no sliding at all.<br />This is one great bra and I definitely recommend it.This bra is comfortable enough. There's no poking or jabbing from the underwire, it has good support, and the padding is just the right amount being not too big or too small. This bra has very nice front adjustable straps. I love that. It's so annoying when you realize that perhaps your straps aren't exactly as they should be and you have to do some weird dance trying to get to the adjustable part to fix it all up. This is a great feature. It also has mesh side coverage panels that are great for getting a little breath-ability and also to help hide unsightly underarm bulge.

Great price and fits well on my larger ladies.Cute and flattering, and a great price and fit for us larger ladies.I love this bra so much. It's very rare you find a bra that looks good, fits well, especially if you're large-chested. Bra is a little bit saggy, but fits well and I love the style and front closure. Bought two this time and don't regret it!One of my new favorite bras: adorable, fits well, holds my girls tight. I wish all my bras were this great.This is a great sports bra for a good price. The mesh overlay can be adjusted to make the fit a little tighter and I love it. I'm hoping that in the longer term, the hooks that adjust the overlay will stand up to the beating that my 40F ladies give it.

The good news - these are nice, comfortable Chinos with just a bit of stretch that makes all the difference. These fit nicely and wear well, all day long.<br /><br />But they are definitely white. Really white. The slightest bit of dirt or a stain shows on them. So while I like them a lot, they don't generally make to lunch without something I've done showing up on them.These are almost exactly what I was hoping for. Nicely fitting pants that look good and move with you all day long. Pants I can wear to work to look just a bit more dressy and professional.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is the nature of my job to deal with light powders and other materials that are attracted to this pants like a magnet. The navy color ensures that every bit of powder and dust shows. And sadly, the fabric doesn't allow me to just brush this away.<br /><br />So by lunch, that professional look has turned into something different.<br /><br />If you have an office job, these are probably perfect. But if you work outside or around dirt or dust, they will show everything.I really like these Chinos. Classic cut, they can be dressy as you want them to be. I wore a black merino sweater with these and some chukas and got a lot of compliments.<br /><br />So what's not to love? These are supposed to have a 30 inch inseam. That is a tad long for me, usually, but OK. 29 is probably right, but near impossible to find.<br /><br />Imagine my shock to find these just a bit short!!!! I don't know how that is possible. I can tell you my legs have not lengthened (much that I might wish they did). These were still OK, but I could feel them riding up and I was glad I was wearing chukas and not regular shoes.<br /><br />I don't know if my pair just got cut a bit short or if this is a problem with the line. I will say I've had Dockers khakis in the past and they were cut just as I would expect.<br /><br />So 5 stars if they fit perfectly, but the short legs cost them a star."}, "AHVYJTCVY4KGNT4XARQBSJNQMWVQ": {"user_profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality, durable products, particularly in the categories of clothing and accessories.

I really like the shirts I've gotten from this Amazon owned line but $25 per dress shirt started hitting my wallet a little harder than I wanted to admit. I then found that I could get a dress shirt that seemed very similar in the Amazon Essentials line. All in all, I like this shirt. It's only $18 versus $25 and seems to be made of the same material. The only major difference is the fit. I own several Goodthreads shirts that are slim fit like this one from Amazon Essentials. The Goodthreads version has more of a tailored feel to it on my 5'11\" 197 lbs frame. The Amazon Essentials version has a slim fit but it's a bit more loose. If I had to say which shirt I preferred, I'd give the edge to the more expensive Goodthreads shirt but with that being said, the Amazon Essentials shirt is a great alternative if you'd like to save $7.As a fan of checked/plaid shirts, I really like this button up shirt from Goodthreads. You can dress it up with a suit and/or tie or dress it down with a nice pair of comfortable jeans or chinos. It's made with great care and a quality shirt. If I have any complaint with this garment, it's that the sleeves don't have the same fit as the slim fit oxford style shirts I've purchased from Goodthreads. Also, the gray in the shirt doesn't seem to be as vibrant in person as it is online.

I'm a 5'11\" man and weigh 191 lbs so if you're that size and debating between the regular or slim-fit, the slim-fit has less material and fits closer to your body to give a more tailored look.

It offers as much support as an under wire bra without the under wire! It is super comfortable and I can literally wear it all day without any discomfort. The band isn't too tight and the shoulder straps don't dig in either. I am very happy!This cotton panties are pretty comfortable. The cotton material is not scratchy or rough, but it's not as soft as I would prefer. The waistband is a thin, covered elastic band that doesn't bind.

Overall, these are a decent, affordable product.I have been searching for an affordable and comfortable bra for the past several months. I've been tired of wires poking out & uncomfortable bands. This bra is comfy and offers adequate support. I don't feel the need to take my bra off as soon as I come home from work anymore!! It's not very pretty - it's just a basic bra, but I'm pleased with it nonetheless.I've been having a bra 'slump' lately. I've been very unhappy with the bras I've been wearing. First of all, my bras need to be thick enough so the nipples aren't visible. At my age (late forties), it's not a pretty thing. I also like my bras to provide nice shape. No uni-boob! I want my bras to be comfortable, too, so I don't have to rush home at the end of the day to take it off. This Playtex bra is very pretty. It's sometimes hard to find a bra that is pretty and meets all my requirements. The cups are padded enough that the nipples are not showing through, but it's also not too thick that I feel like I am wearing a padded bra. I wear a 42DD, I don't need padding! The bra gives a nice shape. I wish the band could be a little tighter. I think that would help with the lifting of girls, too. Or maybe in this brand, I need to go with a 40DD instead. It's pretty comfortable, too. The straps don't dig into my shoulders and I am not rushing home after work to take it off. Overall, I am very pleased with my new bra.This is a very comfy bra. The material is so soft! I am a 40DD and this bra fits nicely on me. There is no spillage out of the cups. The straps are adjustable so it provides a decent lift. I would feel fine wearing this at home or to run errands.My nearly 19 year old daughter loves the comfort of bralettes. While this doesn't provide as much support as a traditional bra, it does provide some support. And it provides more support than some other ones. She wears a 34D bra and the large size fits quite nicely on her. She's really right between a C & D cup, but too often, she has spillage in some C cups. The straps are adjustable which is something that a lot of bralettes don't have. The fabric is very soft and the garment is comfortable to wear. She is very happy with it!This is a cute bralette. I ordered it for my 19 year old daughter. She wears a size 34C/D. We got this in a large and it fits well on her. The material is soft and comfortable. It offers some support, but not a whole lot. The straps aren't binding.My 17 year old daughter loves sports bras. She wears them whenever she can get away with it. This offers plenty of support. The sizing is accurate. She is 5'7\" and weighs about 150 pounds. She wears a 34C-D bra size and usually wears medium sports bras. This fit as expected. There is a visible tag which impacts the reversibility of the item. I will probably try to remove it for her.This is a snug fitting sports bra. It has a definite compression quality. My daughter wears a 34D and found that this was a tight fit. Looking at the brand specific size chart, the medium was the right size. She says it's comfortable, but not the most comfortable bra she's ever worn. The straps don't dig into her shoulders. Overall, it's good, but she says she would like to try the next size up.It's been a long time since I've worn a front fastening bra. There are definitely some advantages to that, but it was also a bit tricky to figure out. The bra is really beautiful! It's also pretty comfortable. The cup size fits perfectly without any spillage out the top. The band is nice and wide. The bra does a good job of lifting and creates a nice shape. The construction of the garment seems to be good.This is a beautiful bra that has an excellent fit. Several years ago, I went to one of those fancy bra stores. It was probably the first time I had ever had a proper bra fitting. I walked out of the store with 3 bras (and one pair of matching panties) and I had spent over $400! This line of bras reminds me of the quality bras that I bought then. This doesn't dig into my shoulders. It supports my DD's comfortably. I would definitely recommend giving these a try!I wear a 40DD/42DD. This is a 40 band. It barely fit me, so if you are in between band sizes like I am, go with the larger one. The cup size fit well. Once it was on, it was comfortable. I've never worn an underwire sports bra. It gave lots of support. It's a compacted fit, so there's minimal bouncing or jiggling.

I really detest underwire bras (don't we all!) so I was apprehensive about getting ample support from a wire-free bra but this bra's band really 'holds me up' comfortably. Speaking of comfort: the straps are fully adjustable and are just wide enough to not dig into my shoulders but not so wide that it looks like I'm wearing an 'old lady bra,' if that makes sense to any of you ladies out there. There is a nice reinforced band below the cups in the front (actually it goes all the way around) and so far it hasn't been doing that weird 'folding under' thing that some bras do. I'm not tugging it down or pulling it up; it stays where I put it and I really like this bra.I bought this on a whim, since it was an Amazon deal and I've been tossing around the idea of replacing some of my worn-out bras. Hanes is a funny brand - their socks are horrible but some of their hoodies and shorts are pretty good quality. So I was skeptical when I ordered this bra, but I'm glad that I ordered it.<br /><br />This is, for me, a just-about-perfect bra. It is wire-free. It is breathable. The straps adjust to that perfect point where they're supportive but not digging into my shoulders. The hooks/clasps on the back lie flat and don't roll around or bunch up. There's no 'roll under' in the front. I'm not constantly tugging it down. The cups are lined, but not comically so (there's a natural look, but you can't tell I'm cold).<br /><br />10/10, just ordered three more in blue, black and white!I ordered five different bras (all 38C) from five different brands at five different price points.<br /><br />This bra by Fruit of the Loom really surprised me because while it is the least expensive of the bunch, it is by far the most comfortable. The straps, band and cups are not itchy.<br /><br />The sizing is accurate. The coverage is perfect, too. It stays in place with no riding up or rolling under. The size I ordered (38C) has three hook and eye closures on the band (the photo shows only 2). There is no bunched up or sagging fabric. The padding is ample; and not in an obvious way but more in a 'I work with all men and they'll never know when I am cold' kinds of way.<br /><br />I deducted a star because within the cups there are a few mysterious dark 'balls' under the outermost layer of fabric. They're small, sort of similar to 'pocket fuzzies' but that's just a guess.

Great for lounging or working.<br /><br />No issues with fit, construction, or design.This is a soft, comfortable shirt that feels great. It is very warm, which is a plus in the winter months. Nice workmanship.This is a great-looking shirt that fits true-to-size. Solid construction, and it's a bit warm. There's nothing I don't like about it.This shirt isn't going to transform you into a captain of industry. Instead, you might take up whittling or restoring antique lawnmowers. It's a relaxed, laid back shirt for a relaxed, laid-back guy (or girl). Everything has its purpose, and this shirt has its definite role to fill. It's fine for bumming around on the weekend, or, paired with a grey suit sans tie, playing the role of the helpful, avuncular peer or even leader. The truly avant-garde may experiment with a contrasting patterned blazer and even tie, but as Dr. Who said in 'Planet of Death,' we do so at the cost of total responsibility. I don't think you'll have to throw yourself into an anti-matter breach to protect the known universe if your patterning goes wrong, but you get the idea.

This extra just got all (sorry :( but sweaty). And the actual cup size was not smooth fitting, it too had extra space. All this being said, I found it very comfortable. I just wish it fit better. The seams were slightly scratchy but I think a soak of Downy may help with that. It was somewhat supportive as the straps were thicker than usual and while I am keeping this one, I feel going down in cup size (normally I'm a 46D) a size C might work better for me. I am considering trying a smaller cup and ordering another. Hope this helps;)I love this bra. Except, for me, the spandex back is just slightly too hot and like another reviewer said 'the nipples show through' and that bothers me.. Excellent for everything else.

It has a very deep plunge and doesn't provide much coverage. The deep blue color is gorgeous -- nothing flash, but a nice alternative to black. Beautiful bra.These are very, very nice panties. They are smooth, comfortable, and stretchy -- and they provide good coverage -- don't ride up at all. I really like the neutral beige color. I've had great experience with Vanity Fair panties over the years. They last forever, and I trust that these will be no exception. My only gripe with these is that the 'x3' does really make you think you're getting three pairs, so it is a little disappointing when only one pair shows up. I think these are comparable in quality to Wacoal panties and may be worth the higher price -- but the labeling is a little misleading.This bra is SO COMFORTABLE!! No pinching, no pulling, and NO WIRES!!. The neckline comes up fairly high, effectively concealing any cleavage. I wouldn't limit this bra to the gym -- I would definitely wear this with street clothes, especially where I would otherwise wear a black tank or camisole, such as under a lower cut top. I would not be at all hesitant for this to be visible under clothes, particularly at the neckline. The straps are wide and nicely padded, and they are sufficiently close-set so there is no shoulder strap slipping. I think this bra is super supportive and comfortable, and will be perfect for traveling and times when I just don't want to mess with an underwire. I don't think it provides the best shaping, as it has a seam that runs diagonally across the cup -- but it's not bad. I wouldn't recommend it under super form-fitting tees for that reason.There's plenty to like about this bra -- it is comfortable; it is low-cut, so it is easy to hide under many necklines; it has a convenient front clasp, which is uncommon for larger-sized bras; and the straps stay up! I particularly like the fact that the cups seemed to be very full coverage and stayed in place throughout the day -- sometimes lower cut and front-clasp bras don't do a good job of keeping the essentials covered, as they tend to shift around during the day.

I like the fabric on this Amazon-brand one, but the edge trimming irritates my skin a bit.  The front also comes up a bit higher than I'd like, and so it looks a little more matronly.  While more expensive, I prefer the ones from Soma or Truly.I bought this in my usual size small, and it fits great.  While it doesn't quite have the anti-static properties of my favorite Farr West half-slips, it keeps my dresses from clinging to my tights, especially during these dry winter months.  The reversible nature is great, and the higher side works great under wrap or lower-cut dresses.  The straps are also adjustable (which is great for us shorter gals), and it has enough fabric so that it doesn't stretch and get sheer across the bustline if you have a D-sized chest.  Great slip for the price!I ended up ordering this one size up from what I usually wear based on reviews that said it ran small, but should have stuck with my usual size.  I ended up keeping it and wearing it since I needed it to go under a dress I was wearing to a party. The damask color is just as it appears on the screen -- a beautiful nude color that blended in perfectly with the nude underlay of the blue lace dress I wore. Since I bought this larger, it didn't suck anything in on me, but it nicely smoothed out my bumps a bit and was comfortable to wear. The adjustable straps are also a nice bonus, since they allow you to adjust how high or low you want the front of the cami to sit.This bra is comfortable for home use.  Since it doesn't have any front padding, I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it for Zoom meetings while working at home, but it's great for light support around the house.I have a few different styles in the Truly bras, and love them all.  They provide good support for my natural 32DD chest, and this particular style does provide a slight lifting effect.  They wash well on delicate in a mesh bag and laid flat to dry.  I wish these were cheaper than they are, but they're perfect for me as a work-from-home and weekend bra, and the padding helps avoid any headlights.I've been working at home due to the pandemic for about eighteen months, and have moved to using bralettes like these because they are so comfortable.  This one doesn't have enough padding for me to feel comfortable wearing it on Zoom calls, but if I don't have meetings, it's nice.  It's not a lot of support for my 32DD chest, but does offer some.I'm a natural 32DD, and this bralette doesn't quite provide enough support for me.  The fabric is soft, though, and, even though it's unlined, it provides decent coverage so that there is little show-through.I ordered this in my recommended size, but it creates a buckled look in the middle that looks odd under T-shirts.  I do like that this gives good support to my 32DD chest, but may end up donating it since it doesn't quite work with my chest shape.This is my first True & Co bra, and I like it for my work from home lifestyle.  It's comfortable enough for all-day wear, and doesn't have headlight show-through.  I've been washing it in a mesh lingerie bag on delicate and laying it flat to dry, and it doesn't show any pilling or signs of wear.I have a few similar bralettes from Soma that I love and I had thought that this would be similar, but the cut on this is so high in the sides that it chafes under the arms.  The padding also isn\u2019t thick enough to prevent show-through, and it fits on the smaller side.  On the plus side, the fabric is soft and it washes up well. For my shorter body type, though, it\u2019s just not comfortable.I usually size up to mediums in lounge bras like this, but went with the recommended size small.  It offers great support, and isn't too tight at all.  I also love the fuller cup for my DD chest since I don't spill out. It also offers a small lift, which is nice to find in lounge bras.  The pads are removable, and the slight V dip in the front makes it feel more modern than bras that run straight across."}, "AHTAI3MFR724GEN7SXDCPWTHVEXA": {"user_profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for comfortable, practical clothing and accessories, particularly in the men's category.

They seem to fit my feet better than most sneakers however I ordered a 6 which is my normal sneaker size and these were a little bit wide so I would have sized down half a size to a 5.5.

The bottom band literally feels like it isn't there and the cups are very soft with just enough padding for modesty. Whoever designed this bra knew what they were doing! I will order more of these in different colors. Thank-you Hanes!Just to give you an idea of how long this slip is, I'm 5'8\" and it comes to about two inches below my knees. I love that there's no cling whatsoever with the cotton skirt I use this slip with, and it doesn't cling to me either. There's a nice amount of stretch in the waist (mine is 27\" and there's MORE than enough room). I normally wear a size 10 skirt and this size is perfect (I weigh 140 pounds); highly recommend!....I usually wear a 40D, but this was one size too large. Instead of the xlrg, I should've gone with the large. That's just how some things are made, I guess. You kind of take a bit of a chance. So, I hope this helped someone to make a better decision. (In case anyone was wondering, yes, I did put them through the wash to try and shrink them, but they really don't shrink much to speak of.)There was literally nothing I didn't like about this bra, except maybe just a tad more padding in the front for modesty. It's been such a long time since I've actually been comfortable in a bra. It covers the sides perfectly, is very supportive in the front, and it doesn't dig in around the bottom band. If you're looking for a bra that gives you cleavage, this isn't it, but if you're looking for something that is so comfortable that it almost feels like you're not wearing a bra, look no further.Very high quality product, but ran a little bit smaller than my other size 38's."}}
