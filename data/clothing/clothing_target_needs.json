It isn't shiny like some dress shirts, and because of its heavy fabric, it doesn't wrinkle as easily as some casual shirts. In short, this shirt passes muster in both the dress up and dress down worlds. And as an Amazon Essentials brand, it is very affordable, at $16.00.

As I expect for a designer shirt, it is well constructed. There is a very small CK label at the breast. I'm not a fan of visible designer labels, but this one is unobtrusive enough for me to ignore. However, my normal complaint about the premium paid for designer labels is certainly true in this case. This large shirt lists at $57, which is crazy high, as nice as it is. I can find comparable, non-designer shirts at lower prices. There's also a weird difference in price for this shirt depending on the size you select. The price ranges from about $25 to about $60, despite that they all seem to be shipped and sold by Amazon rather than third-party sellers. Weird. At any rate, buyer beware.",

They are mostly 34A with maybe a couple 36A. I have been an A cup my whole life (except for right after giving birth) but I'm just not fitting into them well anymore. Honestly, I'm probably more of an A-plus or B-minus than a full B cup, but since neither of those were an option I decided to give the 36B a try.<br /><br />It fits nicely, with just a touch of extra room. It feels so nice not to be crammed into the wrong size bra anymore, with nothing bulging out from the top or sides. It looks really good and smooth, and feels nice and silky on the skin. There is no pinching, itching or discomfort. I really love this bra and I want to try other Warner's styles. I highly recommend this bra, it's a great value and a good quality product.",

He doesn't like tight fitting shirts and he normally wears a size large. The large size in this shirt fits him perfectly and even has a little more length to it than most shirts we find which we loved because my husband has a slightly longer torso and hates when his shirts ride up when he's working on things, so having that extra inch or so in length makes all the difference!<br /><br />The shirt also offers exceptional color options. We purchased the navy blue color and black color and it is very vibrant in person. The shirt itself looks exceptionally well made and durable. Again, they are a nice thick cotton and not a thin shirt and is so insanely comfortable. We've washed it a few times now and it's held up beautifully and hardly shrank if at all!

He doesn't like tight fitting shirts and he normally wears a size large so that's what I originally purchased. Unfortunately I had forgotten that Carhartt runs larger than other brands so I had to return the large and exchange it for a medium. One thing we LOVE about Carhartt shirts is that they tend to run a little longer than other brands of t-shirts. My husband has a slightly longer torso and hates when his shirts ride up when he's working on things so having that extra inch or so in length makes all the difference!<br /><br />The color options in this t-shirt are absolutely beautiful and are identical to the photos. They are great looking t-shirts and all of the colors are very vibrant in person. The t-shirt also has the Carhartt logo printed across the chest. This shirt is truly a great, all purpose work shirt that you can wear all year round. They are so insanely comfortable. My husband LOVES it. Definitely recommend!!",

The shirt is also a bit see thru.

The waist is a little snug and I got my regular size of 36 not even needing that extra elasticity in the waist. The material is a combination of being a little heavy and soft at the same time. Certainly ideal for summer. The heaviness doesn't make them too warm. I do find them to be more formal shorts, even more dressy than Docker shorts. They sit directly at the waist (perhaps the reason for the snugness) and fall to right above the knee. I see them more as shorts for older guys or someone who likes very dressy attire. Nice with a button down shirt or polo but not casual enough to wear with a tank or t shirt. Very well made and durable with nice deep pockets. I am happy to add them to my summer collection but do prefer my shorts a little more versatile. But that is just a preference of mine. The quality and fit of these will suit your needs very well if they are your preferred style.",

They appear to be made well, with sturdy hardware (zipper, button), which is important when you expect a pair of jeans to last for awhile. They do run a little large, especially in the waist. The waist rides a little high on me. Also, they are longer than my other jeans, which, for me, is an inconvenience. I generally just wear flat shoes with my jeans, and these are going to hit the floor (even though I am 5' 8\" tall), which will probably cause them to wear out and eventually fray at the bottom. I may end up rolling them up and cuffing them.<br /><br />Other than that, the material is very stretchy, soft, and comfortable. I did a lot of sitting, standing up, and stretching, and just movement in general and the jeans were very comfortable and fluid. I would have given them 5 stars except for the long length (these are labeled as Medium length), and, also, the fabric has that awful, strange chemical smell straight out of the package. So much so, I wore a thin pair of pants underneath these jeans in order to try them on before I wrote this review. I didn't want the chemicals next to my skin, and they are going straight into the laundry hamper before wearing.<br /><br />Would I recommend these jeans to a friend? Yes. The price is great.

            "review": "I almost didn't order these jeans because my normal size for pants in other styles is a 20, and a 22 in Wrangler jeans is even just slightly on the large size. But, I figured, these are Levi's (which I have always found to fit small for the size), and, they are also skinny jeans, which means they may be even smaller than a normal size 24. Well, I am very pleased to report that the size 24 worked great for me. If you wear a 24 in other brands of jeans, I would definitely go up a size. I didn't want to dock any stars from my review for the size issue since it is so common with Levi's brand to begin with. Plus, the jeans are fantastic. They are super stretchy and really comfortable. They move when you move, and they don't bag out after wearing for awhile. The hardware and the seams are all top quality and done very well. My favorite part about them is that for a denim jean, they are lightweight. They are not your typical heavy denim, and will not weigh you down in any way. It also means they can dress up, depending on what type of shirt or sweater you wear with them. If you like heels, these look great with heels. I am 5'7\" to 5'8\" tall (not too sure these days...getting older), and the length is really nice for me. It's perfect for flats or heels. I definitely recommend these jeans for quality and comfort, just know how you personally fit into Levi's jeans and order your size accordingly. You will be pleased.",

They have just enough spandex and combination of other fabrics to make them fit close to the body, and it also gives them great movement--they move when you do. The workmanship is perfect, and I would expect nothing less from Levis. My adult granddaughter absolutely loves them. She is probably closer to a size 28, but even though these are a size bigger, they still fit. They are slightly loose in the waist, but, that just means she won't have to unbutton them after a big meal! The looser waist also means she can tuck in tops, even those with bulkier fabrics. She is average height (about 5' 4\") and the length is perfect on her. They can easily be worn with both flats and heels. I think these jeans are pretty close to perfect, and so does she.

The fit is absolutely true to size (even though the manufacturer suggests going a size down--maybe due to the stretch). If you are between sizes, then I would suggest going with the smaller of the two sizes, because otherwise you may find them too big in the waist. These jeans are designed for women with curves.<br /><br />The ankle length is really cute, and they look great with heels or a simple pair of flats (pairing them with flats gives you a great retro look). If you are not very tall, then the ankle length style may actually fit you just as a 'regular length' pair of jeans. One thing I really like is that while they may be 'skinny' jeans in style, they are not so tight (especially around the ankle bottom) that they feel constricting. They are machine washable, too. I absolutely love them.<br /><br />NOTE: If you are looking for this brand of skinny jeans in a similar (but not exactly the same), full length style, you can check out: [[ASIN:B06Y4J7BZR Jen7 Women's Skinny Jeans, Black Knit, 12]].",

The recycled cotton material is soft and there must be some sort of padding inside as it does have some cushion. There are a lot of pockets and compartments for storage and is able to withstand what I would consider a good bit of weight. This is what I would consider a good size bag for daily activities - not too big and not too small either. The strap is comfortable and makes this easy to carry for an extended period of time. The overall design is also very nice and the colors look good. This bag is very versatile with what you can carry and hold in it.

I really like the shirts I've gotten from this Amazon owned line but $25 per dress shirt started hitting my wallet a little harder than I wanted to admit. I then found that I could get a dress shirt that seemed very similar in the Amazon Essentials line. All in all, I like this shirt. It's only $18 versus $25 and seems to be made of the same material. The only major difference is the fit. I own several Goodthreads shirts that are slim fit like this one from Amazon Essentials. The Goodthreads version has more of a tailored feel to it on my 5'11\" 197 lbs frame. The Amazon Essentials version has a slim fit but it's a bit more loose. If I had to say which shirt I preferred, I'd give the edge to the more expensive Goodthreads shirt but with that being said, the Amazon Essentials shirt is a great alternative if you'd like to save $7.",

The straps, band and cups are not itchy.<br /><br />The sizing is accurate. The coverage is perfect, too. It stays in place with no riding up or rolling under. The size I ordered (38C) has three hook and eye closures on the band (the photo shows only 2). There is no bunched up or sagging fabric. The padding is ample; and not in an obvious way but more in a 'I work with all men and they'll never know when I am cold' kinds of way.<br /><br />I deducted a star because within the cups there are a few mysterious dark 'balls' under the outermost layer of fabric. They're small, sort of similar to 'pocket fuzzies' but that's just a guess. If I were wearing a tight shirt, you'd definitely notice them.",

These have a great feel to them for walking and jogging on pavement. My feet never hurt when I wear these. They are a bit pricier but they\u2019re worth it!",
