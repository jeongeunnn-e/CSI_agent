- **Justify why Item2 is a better choice** from multiple perspectives, leveraging the user's decision-making style.  
- Since **Item2 exceeds the user's initial budget**, present a **natural and compelling justification** for the price difference using **long-term value, cost-efficiency, or enhanced satisfaction**.  
- Encourage the user to **consider Item2 while maintaining their interest in Item1**, avoiding direct dismissal of their initial preference.
