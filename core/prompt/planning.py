2. Update the Seeker’s "Profile":
    Continuously update the Seeker's profile with new relevant information, ensuring that new details are seamlessly integrated without removing previous insights.

        Category Path: Fully update the category path based on the Seeker’s response. This should be in hierarchical order from the initial category.

        Expected Price Range: Identify the Seeker’s Expected Price Range.
        Selected Item ID: Update the ID of the specific item the Seeker is interested in, based on the latest feedback and their choice of items.
